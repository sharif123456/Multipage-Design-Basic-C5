				<p> 1. Detangle your hair before each wash. </p>
				<p>  2. Choose your shampoo based on your scalp and not on the condition of your lengths and ends. Our mild and neutral shampoo and conditioner with vegetable keratin allows you to personalize them by adding our boosters to essential and vegetable oils already dosed for a bottle of shampoo or conditioner, depending on your hair type.
               </p>
				<p>  3. Always do 2 washes for your shampoo: the first wash and the second milking. It is advisable to space your washes 2 to 3 times a week.</p>
				<p>  4. Note that a shampoo does not need to foam abundantly to be effective. On the contrary, because it is the sulphates that give this very foaming side but at the risk of drying out the hair.</p>
